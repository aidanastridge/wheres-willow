## üîé Wheres Willow?

### Inspired by "Where's Waldo?"

#### This dataset generator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095418359671869440?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on simulating data with Chat GPT, I wanted to use the tutorial for fun!

One thousand data points were generated. There is one "Willow" that will be unique for each simulation. However, this dataset is more useful for EDA and data visualization practice.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I might have missed something, I'm only human!
