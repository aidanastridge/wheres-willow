# üîé Wheres Willow?

### Do no hesitate in contributing, this dataset simulator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095418359671869440?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on simulating data with Chat GPT, I thought about how I could make "Where's Waldo?" into a csv dataset or relational database. Unfortunately, having one "Waldo" would be too simple. Instead, it's the descriptors that make the data points interesting.

I also changed the character name to "Willow" because I wanted to be different.

One thousand data points were simulated, but you can change that to whatever you would like.
Truthfully, there might not be a unique "Willow." (Birth date might be distinct) But you can still filter and search for one. Also, you can do EDA because the descriptors are not uniformly distributed.

This repository is open for anyone  to contribute:
- Fine tune the simulation? Go ahead!
- Add more descriptors? Sure.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I might have missed something, I'm only human!
