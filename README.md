# üîé Wheres Willow?

#### Do no hesitate in changing the parameters, this dataset simulator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095418359671869440?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on simulating data with Chat GPT, I wanted to use the use the tutorial for fun!

One thousand data points were simulated, but you can change that to whatever you would like.
There is one "Willow" that will be unique for each simulation. However, this dataset is more useful for EDA practice.

This repository is open for anyone  to contribute:
- Fine tune the simulation? Go ahead!
- Add more descriptors? Sure.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I might have missed something, I'm only human!
