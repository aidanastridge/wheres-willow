# ðŸ”Ž Wheres Willow?

### Do no hesitate in contributing, this dataset simulator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a blog post on simulating data, I thought how could I make "Where's Waldo?" into a csv dataset or relational database. Unfortunatly, having one "Waldo" would be too simple. Instead, it's the descriptors that make the data points interesting.

I also changed the character name to "Willow" because I wanted to be different.

1000 data points are simulated, but you can change that to whatever you would like.
Truthfully, there might not be a unique "Willow." But you can still filter and search for one. Also, you can perfrom EDA on the data.

This repository is open for anyone  to contribute:
- Fine tune the simulation? Go ahead!
- Add more descriptors? Sure.
- Think you can do it better? You probably can.
