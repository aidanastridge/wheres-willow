# üîé Wheres Willow?

### Do no hesitate in contributing, this dataset simulator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095418359671869440?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on simulating data, I thought how could I make "Where's Waldo?" into a csv dataset or relational database. Unfortunately, having one "Waldo" would be too simple. Instead, it's the descriptors that make the data points interesting.

I also changed the character name to "Willow" because I wanted to be different.

One thousand data points were simulated, but you can change that to whatever you would like.
Truthfully, there might not be a unique "Willow." But you can still filter and search for one. Also, you can perform EDA on the data.

This repository is open for anyone  to contribute:
- Fine tune the simulation? Go ahead!
- Add more descriptors? Sure.

I'm going to change the random operation as it isn't that interesting when all the decsiptors are given a uniform distribution.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I might have missed something, I'm only human!
